# 📚 DSA Practice Repository

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-Started-blue)

I'm practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) every day to improve my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. This repository contains all the problems I solve, organized by topic. I use Python for all implementations and update this repository regularly to stay consistent and track my progress.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- `Revision_1/` — Problems I couldn't solve initially and need more practice.
- `Revision_2/` — Problems I solved confidently after revisiting.

📝 **Revision Strategy**:
- Problems I struggle with are placed in `Revision_1/`.
- Once I solve them successfully, they are moved to `Revision_2/`.
- Problems solved confidently in `Revision_2/` are removed.
- If unsolved in `Revision_2/`, they are moved back to `Revision_1/`.
- End of every month, I focus on solving all the problems in the revision folders.
